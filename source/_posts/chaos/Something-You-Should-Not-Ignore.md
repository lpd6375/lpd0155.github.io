Recently Coronavirus related news are too many to bear. Even when you want some news that are not about the Virus you will find it hard to receive.

It's true that the outbreak is a disaster caused by Bureaucracies'  ignorance. And still the officials are propagandizing those people who are contributing on sacrifice of doctors and nurses or just normal person who did something benefit for containing the disaster. 

I am so sick of propaganda. Whatever the situation is they just can not stop doing propagandizing. I do not know how to tell it, but i do feel bad for every Chinese suffering.
